## Role Ping Mechanism

NEW FOMO, HIGH FOMO, EXTREME FOMO and EXTREME SELL

We are processing whole data to create meaningful pings, Increasing or Decreasing Sales, Increasing or Decreasing BlueChip Index, Increasing or Decreasing listings etc.

For example EXTREME SELL ping is based on current indicators that current listings are increasing, last 5 minutes sales are decreasing and decreasing NDCP score. Combining these datas will trigger this role.

For decreasing noise we ping each collection once for 30 minutes.
